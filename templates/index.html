                        <p>Pearl Jam is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. The band's
                            lineup consists of founding members Jeff Ament (bass guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm
                            guitar), Mike McCready (lead guitar), and Eddie Vedder (lead vocals, guitar), as well as
                            Matt Cameron (drums), who joined in 1998. Keyboardist Boom Gaspar has also been a
                            touring/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers Jack Irons, Dave Krusen, Matt
                            Chamberlain, and Dave Abbruzzese are former members of the band. Pearl Jam outsold many
                            of their contemporaries from the early 1990s, and are considered one of the most
                            influential bands of the decade, being dubbed as "the most popular American rock &
                            roll band of the '90s".
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam
                            broke into the mainstream with their debut album, Ten, in 1991. Ten stayed on the Billboard
                            200 chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock
                            records ever, going 13Ã— platinum in the United States. Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second
                            album, Vs., sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for
                            most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album,
                            Vitalogy (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than
                            877,000 units sold in its first week.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's members often
                            shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or participating in
                            interviews. The band also sued Ticketmaster, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket
                            market. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having "spent much of the past decade
                            deliberately tearing apart their own fame."</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Pearl Jam had sold more than 85 million albums worldwide by 2018, including nearly 32 million
                            albums in the United States by 2012, making them one of the best-selling bands of all
                            time. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 in its first year
                            of eligibility. They were ranked eighth in a readers' poll by Rolling Stone magazine in
                            its "Top Ten Live Acts of All Time" issue. Throughout its career, the band has also
                            promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-abortion rights sentiments to
                            opposition to George W. Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these
                            issues.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The band continues to tour and sell out arenas worldwide.</p>
